          <b>Duck</b> is the common name for numerous species of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anseriformes">waterfowl</a> in
          the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)">family</a>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatidae">Anatidae</a>. Ducks
          are generally smaller and shorter-necked than swans and geese, which
          are members of the same family. Divided among several subfamilies,
          they are a form taxon; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the
          group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species), since
          swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic
          birds, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.

          Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water
          birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules
          and coots.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          The word duck comes from Old English dūce 'diver', a derivative of the
          verb *dūcan 'to duck, bend down low as if to get under something, or
          dive', because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed
          by upending; compare with Dutch duiken and German tauchen 'to dive'.
          Pacific black duck displaying the characteristic upending "duck" This
          word replaced Old English ened/ænid 'duck', possibly to avoid
          confusion with other words, such as ende 'end' with similar forms.
          Other Germanic languages still have similar words for duck, for
          example, Dutch eend, German Ente and Norwegian and. The word ened/ænid
          was inherited from Proto-Indo-European; cf. Latin anas "duck",
          Lithuanian ántis 'duck', Ancient Greek νῆσσα/νῆττα (nēssa/nētta)
          'duck', and Sanskrit ātí 'water bird', among others. A duckling is a
          young duck in downy plumage<sup>[1]</sup> or baby duck,<sup>[2]</sup>
          but in the food trade a young domestic duck which has just reached
          adult size and bulk and its meat is still fully tender, is sometimes
          labelled as a duckling. A male is called a drake and the female is
          called a duck, or in ornithology a hen.<sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup>
